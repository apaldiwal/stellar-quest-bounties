# Improve Stellar Documentation SDK Examples

## Overview
  * **Short Description:** Publish code snippets for different SDKs on Stellar Docs
  * **Bounty:** 500 XLM 
  *	**Estimated Time Commitment:** Variable
  * **Experience Level:** Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
  * **URL:** https://developers.stellar.org/docs/

## Description

### What is this task?

This task involves creating code snippets for SDKs in different languages supported by the Stellar network and improving the user experience of Stellar Documentation.

Currently, Stellar supports JavaScript, Python, Java, Scala, Flutter, Ruby and Go, which means you can interact with the network in your language of choice. However, the code snippets listed on Stellar Docs is limited to a few languages. Therefore, the goal of this task is to ensure there are adequate code examples to make Stellar Docs accessible to any developer (inexperienced to expert), easy and quick to use.

**_Note: The code snippet should cover the all of the examples present on the page of the documentation._**
